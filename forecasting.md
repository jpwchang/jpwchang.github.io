# Derailment Forecasting Papers

Ever since my papers "Conversations Gone Awry" (ACL '18) and "Trouble on the Horizon" (EMNLP '19) introduced and formalized *forecasting conversational derailment* as an NLP task, the task has begun to be picked up by the broader NLP and Computational Social Science communities. This page is an effort to track new models for forecasting derailment from across the community.

If you know of a paper that you think should be included, or you are the author of a new paper or model for forecasting derailment, please contact me so I can add it to the list!
