# Research Interests

My research focuses on finding ways to promote **healthier interactions** in online communities.
I approach this problem both from a *technical* perspective&mdash;developing new algorithms and computational
models to characterize and detect behaviors that are harmful to online communities&mdash;and a *social* 
perspective&mdash;exploring how such technologies can best be leveraged to create tools and policies with a positive impact.

Concretely, I am interested in the following research questions:

- What are the underlying social dynamics of online misbehavior? That is, rather than trying to characterize individual *instances*
of toxicity, harassment, cyberbullying, etc., I want to look one level higher and understand what kinds of contexts/environments might
tend to *produce* such behaviors.
- Can we apply techniques from artificial intelligence, machine learning,
and natural language processing to develop formal models of these dynamics?
- How might such models be used to concretely benefit online communities? For example,
could we use them to inform new policies that are more effective at promoting healthy interactions,
or create new tools to help in the process of content moderation?
